  {
    question: "Do my workers need a new app?",
    answer: "No. Munshi is designed around the interfaces workers already use, especially WhatsApp and voice. The goal is to remove training friction, not add another workforce tool.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Munshi work on WhatsApp?",
    answer: "Yes. WhatsApp-native workflows are central to Munshi. Teams can receive tasks, send updates, share proof, and respond to follow-ups without moving into a separate app.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can teams use voice instead of typing?",
    answer: "Yes. Workers and vendors can respond naturally with voice when typing is inconvenient. This is useful for field teams, shop-floor workers, site staff, and multilingual teams.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Munshi work in local languages?",
    answer: "Yes. Munshi is built for multilingual operating environments where workers may prefer Hindi, English, Hinglish, or local-language communication.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does task verification work?",
    answer: "Munshi can request proof such as photos, text confirmations, voice notes, or structured responses. It then connects those updates to the task so managers receive a verified summary instead of scattered messages.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can vendors interact directly?",
    answer: "Yes. Vendors can receive follow-ups, payment reminders, dispatch confirmations, and delivery coordination messages directly through the same communication layer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Munshi suitable for multi-location businesses?",
    answer: "Yes. Munshi is useful when owners and managers need visibility across outlets, sites, shifts, departments, or vendor networks without manually calling each location.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does leadership receive updates?",
    answer: "Leadership receives concise summaries of completed work, pending items, escalations, and decisions required. The focus is on verified operational clarity, not more dashboard noise.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much operational involvement is required from my team?",
    answer: "Your team defines the workflows, roles, and escalation rules. After that, Munshi handles routine delegation, reminders, update collection, and summaries inside the daily operating rhythm.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Munshi difficult for workers to use?",
    answer: "No. Workers interact through simple prompts, replies, images, and voice notes. The experience is intentionally familiar so adoption does not depend on software training.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Munshi help with attendance and task tracking together?",
    answer: "Yes. Attendance, task assignment, completion tracking, proof collection, and escalation can work together so managers understand both who is available and what is getting done.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Munshi coordinate across departments?",
    answer: "Yes. Munshi can route work across operations, procurement, finance, supervisors, workers, and vendors so the right people receive the right follow-up at the right time.",
  },
